# Face Detection and Tracking with OpenCV

This repository contains two Python programs for real-time face detection and tracking using OpenCV. The first program uses a webcam as the input source, while the second program processes a video file. Both programs utilize OpenCV's Haar Cascade for face detection and the CSRT tracking algorithm for robust face tracking.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifier.
- **Face Tracking**: Tracks the detected face using the CSRT (Channel and Spatial Reliability Tracker) algorithm.
- **Dynamic Status Updates**:
  - Displays "Tracking Face" when the face is successfully tracked.
  - Displays "Lost Tracking" when the face is not detected or tracking fails.
- **Input Options**:
  - Webcam input for real-time face tracking.
  - Video file input for processing pre-recorded videos.

---

## Requirements

To run the programs, you need the following:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (with contrib modules for tracking algorithms)

Install OpenCV using pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python
How to Use
1. Real-Time Face Tracking with Webcam
This program uses your webcam to detect and track faces in real-time.
Steps:
Run the webcam_face_tracking.py script.
The program will open a window showing the webcam feed.
A green rectangle will appear around the detected face, and the status "Tracking Face" will be displayed.
If the face is lost, the status will change to "Lost Tracking."
Press q to exit the program.
Command:
bash


python webcam_face_tracking.py
2. Face Tracking with Video Input
This program processes a video file to detect and track faces.
Steps:
Replace the video_path variable in the video_face_tracking.py script with the path to your video file.
python


video_path = "input_video.mp4"  # Replace with your video file path
Run the script.
The program will display the video with a green rectangle around the detected face and the status "Tracking Face."
If the face is lost, the status will change to "Lost Tracking."
Press q to exit the program.
Command:
bash


python video_face_tracking.py
File Descriptions
webcam_face_tracking.py:
Tracks faces in real-time using a webcam.
Displays a green bounding box around the detected face and updates the tracking status.
video_face_tracking.py:
Tracks faces in a pre-recorded video file.
Similar functionality to the webcam version but processes video input instead.
Customization
Change Input Source:
For the video version, replace the video_path variable with the path to your video file.
Adjust Detection Parameters:
Modify the scaleFactor and minNeighbors parameters in the detectMultiScale function to fine-tune face detection sensitivity.
python


faces = face_cascade.detectMultiScale(gray, scaleFactor=1.1, minNeighbors=5, minSize=(30, 30))
Change Tracker:
Replace cv2.TrackerCSRT_create() with other OpenCV trackers like cv2.TrackerKCF_create() or cv2.TrackerMIL_create() for different tracking algorithms.
Example Output
Webcam Input:
Tracking Face:
A green rectangle is drawn around the detected face.
Status: "Tracking Face" (in green).
Lost Tracking:
No rectangle is displayed.
Status: "Lost Tracking" (in red).
Video Input:
Similar output as the webcam version but processes frames from a video file.
Notes
Ensure your webcam is functional for the real-time tracking program.
For video input, use a valid video file format (e.g., .mp4, .avi).
The CSRT tracker is robust but may fail in cases of extreme occlusion or rapid movement.
